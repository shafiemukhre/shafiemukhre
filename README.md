### oh hey there 👋 welcome to my workshop 🛠️

I am a fullstack software engineer currently based in 🌁 San Francisco, California. My personal website and technical blogs is at [shafiemukhre.com](https://shafiemukhre.com)

Active Projects:
* ⚡️ Flashcode:
* Dashbook: 

> Some of these projects are rough prototypes or not fully built out. Some of it are academic projects, toy projects, mvp, poc and so on. I enjoy building things, so they don't always have to be complete for me to resolve my curiosity in an area. 

Past Projects:

* 📊 [dashbook v0](https://github.com/shafiemukhre/dashbook-archived): Dashboard and notebooks for statistical analysis
* 🏞️ [image segmentation app](google.com): web app to train image data
